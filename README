GENICloud has gone through several iterations with regard to how
virtualization is managed on the platform:

v0.1: use Eucalyptus + KVM (branch 'eucalyptus' in git)
v0.2: use PlanetLab + VServer (branch 'planetlab' in git)
v0.3: use OpenStack + LXC (master in git)


GENICloud v0.3 consists of three conceptual layers:

- MyPLC is used to image and configure the software on the physical
nodes.  We are running a PlanetLab node image based on Fedora 16.

- OpenStack manages the virtualization layer.  We are using Linux
Containers as our virtualization technology.

- The GENI AM API provided by the SFA is the user interface for
creating and deleting virtual machines.  GENICloud is federated with
PlanetLab and accepts PlanetLab-issued credentials.


The structure of this repository is as follows:

install/
- Scripts for setting up OpenStack and SFA on the GENICloud nodes

MyPLC/
- Configuration files at GENICloud Central for managing the deployment

NodeManager/
- Plugins for the PlanetLab NodeManager to specialize the nodes to
run OpenStack
